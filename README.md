## Overview

![screenshot](https://github.com/Jesseekoh/My-Team-Page/blob/main/Screenshot%202022-08-31%20at%2016.28.29.png)

This [Team Page](https://jesseekoh-my-team-page.netlify.app/) is a challenge from devchallenges.io. It was a bit more challenging than the [404-Page-Not-Found challenge](https://jesseekoh-404pagenotfound.netlify.app/) since I had to figure out how to use css grid. This challenge really refreshed my knowledge on pseudo classes and CSS selectors.
